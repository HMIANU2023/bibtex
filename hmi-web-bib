Deontologists seem at a disadvantage here: our best decision theories seem tailor-made for consequentialism. For example, decision theory enjoins us to always perform our best option; deontology is more permissive. In this paper, we discuss and defend the idea that, when some pro-tanto wrongful act is all-things considered permissible, because it is a ‘lesser evil’, it is often merely permissible, by the lights of deontology. We show that this raises new problems for deontological decision theory, and we show that to resolve them, we need to take a more innovative approach to morally evaluating decision-making under risk and uncertainty.},

   journal = {Synthese},
   abstract = {YouTube has been implicated in the transformation of users into extremists and conspiracy theorists. The alleged mechanism for this radicalizing process is YouTube’s recommender system, which is optimized to amplify and promote clips that users are likely to watch through to the end. YouTube optimizes for watch-through for economic reasons: people who watch a video through to the end are likely to then watch the next recommended video as well, which means that more advertisements can be served to them. This is a seemingly innocuous design choice, but it has a troubling side-effect. Critics of YouTube have alleged that the recommender system tends to recommend extremist content and conspiracy theories, as such videos are especially likely to capture and keep users’ attention. To date, the problem of radicalization via the YouTube recommender system has been a matter of speculation. The current study represents the first systematic, pre-registered attempt to establish whether and to what extent the recommender system tends to promote such content. We begin by contextualizing our study in the framework of technological seduction. Next, we explain our methodology. After that, we present our results, which are consistent with the radicalization hypothesis. Finally, we discuss our findings, as well as directions for future research and recommendations for users, industry, and policy-makers.},

   abstract = {Morally supererogatory acts are those that go above and beyond the call of duty. More specifically: they are acts that, on any individual occasion, are good to do and also both permissible to do and permissible to refrain from doing. We challenge the way in which discussions of supererogation typically consider our choices and actions in isolation. Instead we consider sequences of supererogatory acts and omissions and show that some such sequences are themselves problematic. This gives rise to the following puzzle: what problem can we have with a sequences of actions if each individual act or omission is itself permissible? In this paper, we develop a response to this question, by exploring whether solutions analogous to those proposed in the rational choice literature are available in the case of supererogatory sequences. Our investigation leads us to the view that making sense of the supererogatory requires accepting that there are global moral norms that apply to sequences of acts alongside the local moral norms that apply to individual acts.},

In order to establish the existence of such actions, we first need to overcome the so-called paradox of supererogation: we need to provide some explanation for why, if some act is rationally optimal, it is not the case that we are rationally required to carry out that act. We argue that a response to this ‘paradox’ can be found by reflecting on normative conflicts: cases where what is best according to some normative domain is different from what is best according to some other normative domain.},

Previous research has identified a number of barriers to information sharing among agencies: a combination of legal or policy constraints, interagency rivalry and mistrust, and technology. Drawing on ideas from the sociology of information and trust, this article conceptualises the sharing/withholding of information between agencies as dependent on rules as a system of trust. Adapting Richard Ericson?s framework of the different contexts of rule-following and making use of an Australian case study, the article demonstrates how law, culture and technology are intertwined in constraining or enabling access to information.

   title = {CPCES: A planning framework to solve conformant planning problems through a counterexample guided refinement},
   journal = {Artificial Intelligence},
   volume = {284},
   abstract = {We introduce cpces, a novel planner for the problem of deterministic conformant planning. cpces solves the problem by producing candidate plans based on a sample of the initial belief state, searching for counter-examples to these plans, and assigning these counter-examples to the sample, until a valid plan has been produced or the problem has been proved unfeasible. On top of providing a means to compute a conformant plan, the sample can also be understood as a justification for the plan being found, or relevant reasons why a plan cannot be found. We study the theoretical properties that cpces enjoys—correctness, completeness, and optimality—and how the several variants of cpces we describe differ in behaviour. Moreover, we establish a theoretical connection between the cpces framework and well-known concepts from the literature such as tags and width. With this connection we prove the worst case complexity for some variants of cpces. Finally, we show how cpces can be used in a more incremental fashion by learning sequencing of actions from the previous plan being found. Such a technique mimics the use of macro-operators, widely used in automated planning to speedup resolution. Our theoretical analysis is accompanied with a thorough experimental evaluation of the (many) possible incarnations of cpces. This not only proves our theoretical findings from an empirical perspective, but also shows that cpces is able to handle problems that have been traditionally hard to solve by the existing conformant planners, whilst remaining competitive over “easier” conformant planning problems. Importantly, cpces is able to prove many unsolvable conformant planning problems as such, extending substantially the reach of conformant planners.},

We generalise Graph Networks to obtain a new framework for learning over hypergraphs, which we specialise to learn planning heuristics by training over state/value pairs obtained from optimal cost plans. Our experiments show that the resulting architecture, STRIPS-HGNs, is capable of learning heuristics that are competitive with existing delete-relaxation heuristics including LM-cut.

One proposal is that such an agent can simply “reach judgments” on the fly, as needed for decision making. In effect, she can adopt a precise probability function to serve as proxy for her imprecise credences (or set of probability functions) at the point of decision, and then subsequently abandon the proxy as she proceeds to learn more about the world. Contra Bradley, I argue that an agent who employs this strategy does not necessarily act like a precise Bayesian, since she is not necessarily immune to sure loss in diachronic, as well as synchronic, settings. I go on to suggest a method for determining a proxy probability function (via geometric averaging) whereby the agent does act like a precise Bayesian, so understood.},

   abstract = {The Bayesian maxim for rational learning could be described as conservative change from one probabilistic belief or credence function to another in response to new information. Roughly: ‘Hold fixed any credences that are not directly affected by the learning experience.’ This is precisely articulated for the case when we learn that some proposition that we had previously entertained is indeed true (the rule of conditionalization). But can this conservative-change maxim be extended to revising one’s credences in response to entertaining propositions or concepts of which one was previously unaware? The economists Karni and Vierø (2013, 2015) make a proposal in this spirit. Philosophers have adopted effectively the same rule: revision in response to growing awareness should not affect the relative probabilities of propositions in one’s ‘old’ epistemic state. The rule is compelling, but only under the assumptions that its advocates introduce. It is not a general requirement of rationality, or so we argue. We provide informal counterexamples. And we show that, when awareness grows, the boundary between one’s ‘old’ and ‘new’ epistemic commitments is blurred. Accordingly, there is no general notion of conservative change in this setting.},

The celebratory narratives about the use of big data and machine-learning algorithms by private companies to simulate intelligence, improve society, and even save humanity are common and widespread. The deployment of algorithms to automate decision-making also promises to make governments not only more efficient, but also more accurate and fair. Ranging from welfare and criminal justice, to healthcare, national security, and beyond, governments are increasingly relying on algorithms to automate decision-making – a development which has been met with concern by many activists, academics, and members of the general public.1 Yet, it remains incredibly difficult to evaluate and measure the nature and impact of automated systems, even as empirical research has demonstrated their potential for bias and individual harm.2 These opaque and elusive systems often are not subject to the same accountability or oversight mechanisms as other public actors in our legal systems, which raises questions about their compatibility with fundamental principles of public law. It is thus not surprising that numerous scholars are increasingly calling for more attention to be paid to the use of algorithms in government decision-making.3},

   abstract = {&lt;p&gt;Children and young people throughout the world have felt the effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the decisions made in response to the public health crisis, acutely. Questions have been raised about adequately protecting children’s privacy, as schooling, play and socialising went almost exclusively online. However, due to the historical lack of children’s rights being embedded throughout decision-making processes (including important participation rights), the effects of the increased surveillance as a result of the pandemic have not been thoroughly considered. This article pursues three objectives. First, it seeks to develop the literature on the enabling aspects of privacy for children in relation to education and play. Second, it seeks to expand the discussion on the exploitative risks endemic in not protecting children’s privacy, including not only violent harms, but commercial exploitation. Third, it suggests some policy responses that will more effectively embed a children’s rights framework beyond the ‘parental control’ provisions that dominate child-specific data protection frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;},

We distinguish two senses of representational semantics: esoteric semantics, which concern the relationship between a representation and the world, and exoteric semantics, which concern the semantics of representations within a computational framework. Given that pair, we argue that there are three ways in which you could look to cognitive science to answer the job description challenge. Two of those ways make the job description challenge trivial—that is, answerable but uninteresting. We think that the recent literature has focused on readings to the challenge that possess this failing. We argue that Ramsey’s challenge is best understood in terms of the interaction between esoteric and exoteric semantics. This third reading is more complicated to address but more interesting to answer. Understood in this way, the answers to the challenge will be local and case-by-case. On some of these cases, as we review, the challenge is met.},

   abstract = {Role-taking is the process of mentally and affectively placing the self in the position of another, understanding the world from the other’s perspective. Role-taking serves an expressive function within interpersonal interaction, supporting others to pursue instrumental tasks that are recognized, valued, and rewarded. In the present work, we compare role-taking accuracy between white women and black women across status-varying interactional arrangements. Data for this study come from a series of two laboratory experiments. Experiment 1 establishes racial differences in white and black women’s role-taking accuracy, showing that women of color are significantly more attuned to others within social encounters. Experiment 2 implements an intervention to undermine racial disparities in role-taking accuracy, showing that expressive labors equalize when black women are empowered within the social structure. Findings highlight the entwinement of status structures with interpersonal processes while demonstrating the efficacy and value of structural reforms.},

This procedure is executed until a valid plan is found, or it is shown that there is no plan. Experiments show that this approach provides a nice trade-off between fast but unsound, and complete but slow approaches.},
